# OrientDB image

Base image that exposes an [`orientdb`][orientdb] instance, in ports `2424` and
`2480`, using the default root password _0r13ntDB_.

## Running

To execute the image:

```bash
docker run -d --name orientdb kmussel/orientdb
```

It's also possible to redirect `orientdb` ports:

```bash
docker run -d --name orientdb -p 2424:2424 -p 2480:2480 kmussel/orientdb
```

To use another root password, redefine the environment variable
`ORIENTDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`:

```bash
docker run -d --name orientdb -e ORIENTDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecurepassword kmussel/orientdb
```

To persist the data when the container is stopped use the -v option
```bash
docker run --name orientdb -d -p 2480:2480 -p 2424:2424 -e 'ORIENTDB_USER=kincurrentâ€™ -e 'ORIENTDB_PWD=family' -v /var/lib/orientdb kmussel/orientdb
```

After running you'll need to go the url of the {hostip}:2480 and create the database and user that the web app will connect to. 
The environment variables set with the previous command - ORIENTDB_USER & ORIENTDB_PWD will be accessible from the web app when you link the docker containers together.  Docker will expose those env variables but prefixed with the the name of the link and "ENV" like ORIENTDB_ENV_ORIENTDB_USER.
